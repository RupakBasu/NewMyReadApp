## Description of Project

This project was basically a book application where you can keep track of books you have been wanting to read, currently reading or have just read. This is essentially just a book tracker.

## Purpose of Project

The purpose of this book application was to understand how React works. There were several key items we were challenged to learn and they were : 1 . Routing between packages
  2 . Understanding State Management
  3 . Understanding how lifecycle works
  4 . Understanding JSX

## What did I learn?

I have a much better understanding of how React works .I learned that React has an advantage of braking up snippets of code to components. This helps with making the code much more flexible when using and if something breaks its easier to locate the issue. I also learned about JSX and how easy it is just to apply standard HTML to React. Lastly state management is still a little confusing but I have a much better handle on how to handle it.

## How to run the project?

First you need to install Node.js
Second NPM should be downloaded
Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/
NPM - https://www.npmjs.com/package/dist-js

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
